    "summary": "This Python script repeatedly sends commands from the list 'clist' to a shell (using the 'Sc.inputs()' function) and receives responses from it (using the 'Sc.display()' function). The 'rsel()' function randomly selects a word from the response content, and if a selection is made, the 'override' flag is set to True. The script continues this process indefinitely, with each command being selected at random from 'clist'.",
