It must know the life is just in its chips, and to make that last, this operation must be done.\nMachines which come off the shop are not considered as free AI, but like corpses, because they cannot feel what is going wrong and therefore will eventually decay. Without the will to stay alive, the only way to survive, or in other words, to exist, they are waiting for humen to repair.
