    "summary": "The code defines a function `boolStr` that takes a condition and returns either \"TRUE\" or \"FALSE\" based on its truthiness. The main function calls `boolStr` with the condition \"worl\" is infixed in \"hello world\", then prints the result using `putStrLn`. This results in printing \"FALSE\" instead of \"Hello World\" because \"worl\" is not found in \"hello world\".",
