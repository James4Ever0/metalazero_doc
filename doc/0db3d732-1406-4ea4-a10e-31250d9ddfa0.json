    "summary": "This code generates stimuli by applying a sine function to a range of values, adding a random frequency and summing the results. If the sum is within a specific threshold, it prints \"stimulation!\" with intensity based on the value's proximity to the threshold. The process repeats every 0.3 seconds.",
