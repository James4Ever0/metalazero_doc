    "summary": "This code discusses the development of a client for remote control operations. The clients should be used for headless tasks and avoid improper chording keys. It suggests emulating classic Vim modes or decoding chording keycodes (preferably not). Uppercase keys are considered functional/modifier keys, while lowercase keys are normal keys. The purpose includes capturing screenshots and recording videos. Additionally, the code proposes designing a machine-accessible API for scripting purposes.",
