# and once you are agreeing on others, there's no turning back.
# the fucking screen is about to be fucked.

# i do not care about the fucking speed. are you sure that your fucking shit is working or not?
# JUST PURE PYTHON. MAXIMUM COMPATIBILITY.
# what the fuck? shall i do something else?
# why the fuck the shit is not avaliable?
