concurrent design.

Self-hosting DNS. Or something else.

prepare a low-priviliege user, or just use default one or even root?

on x64 it was hell.

[pid  8411] execve("/bin/bash", ["/bin/bash"], 0x7ffc4fd079d0 /* 0 vars */) = ?
[pid  8411] +++ killed by SIGSYS +++	

can we do this without the help of judger? for example, do our own work.
